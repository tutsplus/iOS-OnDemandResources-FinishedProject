### Tuts+ Tutorial: An Introduction to On-Demand Resources on iOS and tvOS

#### Instructor: Davis Allie

In this tutorial, I will show you how to implement on-demand resources in iOS and tvOS applications. By using on-demand resources, you can significantly reduce the size of your app on a user's device as well as host any resources you have on Apple's servers to download at any time, when they are needed.
